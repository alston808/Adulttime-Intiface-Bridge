# AdultTime-Intiface Bridge

A Python bridge that connects Adult Time video content to Buttplug.io/Intiface devices for interactive experiences. This project automatically downloads and synchronizes funscripts with Adult Time videos, providing real-time haptic feedback through connected toys.

## Features

- üéØ **Auto-Funscript Detection**: Automatically finds and downloads interactive content for Adult Time videos
- üîó **Intiface Integration**: Direct connection to Intiface Central for device control
- üåê **Web Interface**: Clean web UI for device management and status monitoring
- üì± **Real-time Sync**: Synchronized haptic feedback with video playback
- üéÆ **Multi-Device Support**: Works with various Buttplug.io compatible devices
- üîÑ **WebSocket API**: Real-time communication between browser and devices
- üìÅ **Funscript Caching**: Intelligent caching system for downloaded scripts
- üéöÔ∏è **Intensity Control**: Adjustable intensity settings for personalized experience

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/) installed and running
- Compatible adult toy devices (Lovense, Kiiroo, etc.)
- Modern web browser with Tampermonkey extension

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adulttime-Intiface-Bridge.git
cd Adulttime-Intiface-Bridge
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Tampermonkey Script
1. Install the [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Open Tampermonkey dashboard
3. Click "Create a new script"
4. Copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js` into the editor
5. Save the script (Ctrl+S)

### 4. Setup Intiface Central
1. Download and install [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/)
2. Start Intiface Central
3. Enable WebSocket server (default port 6969)
4. Connect your devices

## Usage

### Starting the Bridge
```bash
python start_bridge.py
```

The bridge will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Configuration
Create a `config.json` file to customize settings:

```json
{
  "bridge_host": "localhost",
  "bridge_port": 8080,
  "buttplug_url": "ws://localhost:6969",
  "cache_dir": "cache",
  "auto_funscript": true,
  "debug": false
}
```

### Using with Adult Time
1. Ensure the bridge is running
2. Navigate to any Adult Time video
3. The Tampermonkey script will automatically:
   - Connect to the bridge
   - Download available funscripts
   - Sync haptic feedback with video playback

### Web Interface
Visit `http://localhost:8080` to access the control panel:
- View connected devices
- Monitor bridge status
- Manually download funscripts
- Adjust intensity settings

## API Endpoints

### Bridge Status
- `GET /api/status` - Get bridge and device status
- `GET /api/devices` - List connected devices

### Funscript Management
- `POST /api/auto-funscript` - Auto-download funscript for a video
- `GET /api/funscript/{video_id}` - Get cached funscript data
- `POST /api/download-funscript` - Manually download funscript

### Device Control
- `POST /api/connect-buttplug` - Connect to Intiface Central
- `POST /api/video-event` - Send video events (play/pause/seek)

## Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Browser (Tampermonkey) ‚Üê‚Üí Bridge Server ‚Üê‚Üí Intiface Central ‚Üê‚Üí Devices
```

The bridge acts as a middleware layer that:
1. Receives video events from the browser
2. Downloads and processes funscripts
3. Converts timing data to device commands
4. Communicates with Intiface Central via WebSocket

### Supported Formats
- **Funscript (.funscript)**: Industry standard interactive script format
- **Lovense Patterns**: Auto-converted to funscript format
- **Real-time Audio**: Audio level-based intensity (fallback mode)

### Device Compatibility
Works with any Buttplug.io compatible device:
- Lovense toys (Max, Nora, Lush, etc.)
- Kiiroo devices
- We-Vibe products
- Many other manufacturers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bridge won't connect to Intiface Central**
- Ensure Intiface Central is running
- Check that WebSocket server is enabled (port 6969)
- Verify no firewall is blocking the connection

**No funscripts found**
- Not all videos have interactive content
- Try manually searching funscript databases
- Check the video URL format is supported

**Device not responding**
- Ensure device is paired with Intiface Central
- Check device battery level
- Verify device compatibility with Buttplug.io

**Browser script not loading**
- Disable other userscripts that might conflict
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure Tampermonkey is properly installed

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `debug: true` in your config file or running:
```bash
python start_bridge.py --debug
```
